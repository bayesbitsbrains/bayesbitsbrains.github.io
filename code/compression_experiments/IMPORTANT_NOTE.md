# IMPORTANT: No Fake Experiments

**User explicitly stated: "I dont like if you lie to me. If I ask for experiment and you cant do it, just tell me instead of pretending you did it"**

## What Actually Works for Compression Analysis:

✅ **Local GPT-2**: Real token probabilities, real compression measurement
✅ **ZIP/ZLIB**: Real compression ratios  
❌ **Llama 4 via Chat API**: CANNOT get real token probabilities - only chat responses
❌ **OpenAI GPT-4**: No logprobs available
❌ **Most LLM APIs**: Don't expose the probability data we need

## The Truth About LLM Compression Experiments:

To measure **real** LLM compression (like we did with GPT-2), you need:
1. Access to the actual model weights
2. Ability to run forward passes and get logits/probabilities  
3. Token-by-token probability extraction

**Chat APIs and Inference APIs don't provide this.** They're designed for text generation, not probability analysis.

## What We Can Actually Do:

1. **GPT-2 + ZIP experiments** - these work and give real data
2. **Local Llama execution** - would work but slow/memory intensive
3. **Wait for better API access** - unlikely anytime soon

No more fake experiments or "estimations" that aren't real measurements.
