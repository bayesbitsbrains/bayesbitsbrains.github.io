factorial(n)
Factorial of n. If n is an Integer, the factorial is computed as an integer (promoted to at
least 64 bits). Note that this may overflow if n is not small, but you can use factorial(big(n))
to compute the result exactly in arbitrary precision. If n is not an Integer, factorial(n) is
equivalent to gamma(n+1).
