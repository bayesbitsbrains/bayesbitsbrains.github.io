I am pasting a file that contains a minicourse on topics at the intersection of probability, information theory, and machine learning. This is on a website hosted at https://gavento.cz/problens-web/ Feel free to check out the website if it helps, but all important text is pasted. The site also contains multiple widgets that the user can use to play with the concepts. Those are not present in the text i am pasting. 

The site should feel inviting, the tone should be informal, encouraging. I want to preserve the current tone, I don't want the text to feel like written by an LLM. 

I want you to help me with that site. At the very bottom of this prompt, I give you a precise instruction for how i want to help, in all caps. 

TYPOS - give me a list of typos in a particular chapter. The list should be numbered and in format "old text, suggestion, reasoning"
WIDGETS - give me a list of new widgets that I could add. A widget can be something where the user plays with a concept, or tests their understanding of it
MATH - give me a thoughtful analysis of where the text lacks math precision and how can it be improved. Again "old text, suggestion, reasoning"
CONTENT - what content could I add to the chapter? 
DROP - if you had to drop a part (or parts) of the chapter to make it more concise, which one? You can also suggest stuff like "make this expand box advanced", this is half the way to drop it. 
EMOJIS - for each header, list appropriate emojis. Make a mix of emojis that contain some that are matching the topic, and some that are matching less, but are potentially funny/cheeky. 
FUN - How to make the chapter more inviting, more funny? Maybe it's adding a joke, a remark, a link, a picture, etc. 

And here is the list of chapters:

RIDDLES
BAYES
CROSS

MIN_KL
MAX_ENT

If I write more chapters, do it for all of them. If I write ALL, go through all of the chapters. 

And here's the final prompt:
