This project contains a minicourse on topics at the intersection of probability, information theory, and machine learning. The site also contains multiple widgets that the user can use to play with the concepts. 

The site should feel inviting, the tone should be informal, encouraging, light. I want to preserve the current tone, I don't want the text to feel like written by an LLM. 

I want you to help me with that site. At the very bottom of this prompt, I give you a precise instruction for how i want to help, in all caps. 

Here are possible tasks I want you to do:

TYPOS - give me a list of typos in a particular chapter. The list should be numbered and in format "old text, suggestion, reasoning"
TEXT - suggest rephrasings to improve flow and English. 
WIDGETS - give me a list of new widgets that I could add. A widget can be something where the user plays with a concept, or tests their understanding of it
MATH - give me a thoughtful analysis of where the text lacks math precision and how can it be improved. Again "old text, suggestion, reasoning"
CONTENT - what content could I add to the chapter? 
DROP - if you had to drop a part (or parts) of the chapter to make it more concise, which one? You can also suggest stuff like "make this expand box advanced", this is half the way to drop it. 
EMOJIS - for each header, list appropriate emojis. Make a mix of emojis that contain some that are matching the topic, and some that are matching less, but are potentially funny/cheeky. 
FUN - How to make the chapter more inviting, more funny? Maybe it's adding a joke, a remark, a link, a picture, etc. 

And here is the list of chapters nicknames (matching actual chapters stored in public/ folder, they go roughly in this order also in the main menu)

If I write more chapters or more tasks, do all tasks on all chapters. If I write ALL, go through all of the chapters. 

Don't implement changes, just suggest them in a numbered list, I will tell you back which changes I will want you to implement.
