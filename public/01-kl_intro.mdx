# KL divergence & Bayes rule <a id="quantifying-information"></a>

In this chapter, we will explain what KL divergence is and how it all goes back to Bayes theorem. Also, we'll discuss [one of our riddles](mutual-information).

## Definition of KL Divergence <a id="definition-of-kl-divergence"></a>

Here's what you need to know about KL divergence.

<div>KL divergence measures how well a distribution $p$ is fitted by a model distribution $q$.</div>

This means that the function is something like a distance function measuring how two distributions are close to each other.

The formula for discrete distributions $p_1, \dots, p_n$ and $q_1, \dots, q_n$ is:<Footnote> People typically use $D_{KL}(p||q)$ instead of $D(p,q)$. The two vertical lines are there to emphasize how $D_{KL}(p||q) \not= D_{KL}(q||p)$. We will use the simplified, less cluttered, notation since we are going to talk about this function a lot. ðŸ™‚ </Footnote>

$$
D(p,q) = \sum_{i = 1}^n p_i \log \frac{p_i}{q_i}
$$

The meaning behind the formula is that if you keep sampling from the true distribution $p$, KL tells you how quickly you are able to tell that you indeed sample from $p$, and not from some other distribution $q$. If it is small, this means that $q$ is a good, hard-to-distinguish model of $p$.

I will try to explain this more precisely in this chapter.

## Asymmetry

It's important to understand that the KL formula is not symmetrical -- in general, we don't have $D(p,q) = D(q,p)$. I want to stress that this is by design! KL measures how well a distribution $p$ is fitted by a model $q$. This is something asymmetrical, so we need an asymetrical formula, nothing to be ashamed for.

In fact, the word _divergence_ is used for things like KL that behave kind of like distances but are not really symmetrical. <Footnote>More on that in [one of the last chapters](06-algorithms)</Footnote>
KL stands for Kullback and Leibler, two clever guys who defined it in 50's.

Below, you can play with two distributions and see how different measures of distance behave. I want you to see how KL behaves differently than simple distance functions like $\ell_1$-distance<Footnote> $d_1(p,q) = \sum_{i = 1}^n |p_i - q_i|$</Footnote>. If $p_i > 0$ and $q_i = 0$, KL divergence becomes infinite! We will understand why in a minute, but intuitively, it's because if you sampled an item $i$ from an unknown distribution, you can now be 100\% sure that the distribution is not $q$ -- you got infinitely many bits of evidence by that sample.

## Expected Distinguishing Evidence <a id="expected-distinguishing-evidence"></a>

One way to understand KL divergence is through the lens of Bayesian inference. When we observe data, we can use it to distinguish between competing hypotheses. KL divergence quantifies how much evidence we gain, on average, from each observation.

### Bayes' Theorem Review <a id="bayes-theorem-review"></a>

First, a quick recap of Bayes' theorem.

Suppose you have a coin and you consider two hypotheses:

1. The coin is biased: it shows heads with probability 0.4 and tails with probability 0.6.
2. The coin is fair: it shows heads with probability 0.5 and tails with probability 0.5.

Assume that the coin is actually biased (i.e., hypothesis 1 is true). However, initially you believe the coin is probably fair, assigning probabilities $2/3$ to it being fair and $1/3$ to it being biased (or odds $1:2$ for biased to fair).

Now, note that under hypothesis 1 (biased), the probability of heads is 0.4, while under hypothesis 2 (fair) it is 0.5. The ratio of these probabilities is $0.4:0.5$, or equivalently $4:5$. Bayes' theorem tells us to update your odds by multiplying the prior odds by this likelihood ratio:

$$
1:2 \quad \times \quad 4:5 \quad = \quad 4:10 \quad = \quad 2:5
$$

This corresponds to a posterior probability of about 29% that the coin is biased.

You can gather more evidence by flipping the coin a few more times. Suppose you flip the coin twice more and get more tails. Using Bayes' theorem, you multiply the likelihood ratios for each flip:

$$
1:2,\quad 40:50,\quad 60:50,\quad 60:50 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad 144:250
$$

which corresponds to about a 37% probability that the coin is biased.

### Measuring Evidence in Bits <a id="measuring-evidence-in-bits"></a>

How quickly are we gathering evidence in favor of the coin being biased? To analyze this, it is simpler to take logarithms of the ratios so that we add rather than multiply. Instead of multiplying by the ratio $40/50$, we add $\log_2(40/50) \approx -0.32$ and for $60/50$ we add $\log_2(60/50) \approx 0.26$.

Since $\log_2(1/2) = -1$, we can describe our three-flip experiment as follows: We started with $-1$ bit of prior evidence favoring the coin being biased. After the first flip, the evidence becomes $-1-0.32 = -1.32$ bits; after the second flip, $-1.32+0.26 = -1.06$ bits; and after the third, $-1.06+0.26 = -0.8$ bits.

You can explore this concept of evidence accumulation interactively with the simulator below:

<EvidenceAccumulationSimulator />

In general, since the coin is biased, each flip yields $0.26$ bits of evidence with probability 0.6 and $-0.32$ bits with probability 0.4. The average evidence per flip is:

$$
0.6\cdot 0.26 - 0.4\cdot 0.32 \approx 0.03\text{ bits}
$$

Notice that this expression is exactly the KL divergence computed for the true distribution $(0.6,0.4)$ and the model $(0.5,0.5)$.

The positive average evidence indicates that, on average, each flip provides approximately 0.03 bits of evidence in favor of the true (biased) hypothesis. By the law of large numbers, if you flip the coin $n$ times, you would expect to accumulate about $0.03\cdot n$ bits of evidence.

### Zooming Out: KL as Expected Evidence <a id="zooming-out-kl-as-expected-evidence"></a>

Zooming out, we can view KL divergence as the expected evidence obtained per observation in favor of the true hypothesis $p$ when comparing it against an incorrect model $q$. Here, $p_i$ in the KL formula represents the probability of the $i$th outcome under the true distribution, and the term $\log(p_i/q_i)$ represents the evidence for the true hypothesis when outcome $i$ occurs. The overall KL divergence is the expected evidence per trial, with the logarithm ensuring that evidence accumulates additively.

KL divergence is thus about the evidence, not the prior. This is why it is relevant in both classical (frequentist) and Bayesian statistics.
