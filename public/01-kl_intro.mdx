# KL divergence & Bayes rule <a id="quantifying-information"></a>

In this chapter, we will explain what KL divergence is and how it all goes back to Bayes theorem. Also, we'll discuss [one of our riddles](mutual-information).

## Definition of KL Divergence <a id="definition-of-kl-divergence"></a>

Here's what you need to know about KL divergence.

<div>KL divergence measures how well a distribution $p$ is fitted by a model distribution $q$.</div>

This means that the function is something like a distance function measuring how two distributions are close to each other.

The formula for discrete distributions $p_1, \dots, p_n$ and $q_1, \dots, q_n$ is:<Footnote> People typically use $D_{KL}(p||q)$ instead of $D(p,q)$. The two vertical lines are there to emphasize how $D_{KL}(p||q) \not= D_{KL}(q||p)$. We will use the simplified, less cluttered, notation since we are going to talk about this function a lot. ðŸ™‚ </Footnote>

$$
D(p,q) = \sum_{i = 1}^n p_i \log \frac{p_i}{q_i}
$$

The meaning behind the formula is that if you keep sampling from the true distribution $p$, KL tells you how quickly you are able to tell that you indeed sample from $p$, and not from some other distribution $q$. If it is small, this means that $q$ is a good, hard-to-distinguish model of $p$.

I will try to explain this more precisely in this chapter.

## Asymmetry

It's important to understand that the KL formula is not symmetrical -- in general, we don't have $D(p,q) = D(q,p)$. I want to stress that this is by design! KL measures how well a distribution $p$ is fitted by a model $q$. This is something asymmetrical, so we need an asymetrical formula, nothing to be ashamed for.

In fact, the word _divergence_ is used for things like KL that behave kind of like distances but are not really symmetrical. <Footnote>More on that in [one of the last chapters](06-algorithms)</Footnote>
KL stands for Kullback and Leibler, two clever guys who defined it in 50's.

Below, you can play with two distributions and see how different measures of distance behave. I want you to see how KL behaves differently than simple distance functions like $\ell_1$-distance<Footnote> $d_1(p,q) = \sum_{i = 1}^n |p_i - q_i|$</Footnote>. If $p_i > 0$ and $q_i = 0$, KL divergence becomes infinite! We will understand why in a minute, but intuitively, it's because if you sampled an item $i$ from an unknown distribution, you can now be 100\% sure that the distribution is not $q$ -- you got infinitely many bits of evidence by that sample.

## Bayes' theorem

Before we dive into our KL formula, a short recap of Bayes' theorem. This is a theorem about how to change your probabilities in face of evidence. Here's an example:

You have a coin which may or may not be biased. For simplicity, let's say there are only two options: either the coins is fair -- heads/tails with probabilities 50\%, 50\% -- or it gives heads with 40\% and otherwise tails with 60\% probability.

To apply Bayes' theorem, you need a _prior_ on how likely each possibility is. Let's say we choose 50\% fair, and 50\% biased.

To gain evidence, you flip a coin; let's say you got Heads. This is an evidence towards the coin being fair, as the other case has smaller heads-probability. The question is, how to compute the new, _posterior_ probability that your coin is fair?

Bayes' theorem can do that. The formula for it is typically written down as follows:

$$
P(fair | flipped heads) = \frac{P(flipped heads | fair) \cdot P(fair)}{P(flipped heads)}
$$

This is not rocket science -- if you multiply both sides by $P(flipped heads)$, both sides are just a different way of writing down the definition of $P(fair \cap flipped heads)$.

But I like to think of it a bit differently and in my head, I write it as this:

$$
\frac{P(fair | flipped heads)}{P(biased | flipped heads)}
= \frac{P(fair)}{P(biased)} \cdot \frac{P(flipped heads | fair)}{P(flipped heads | biased)}
$$

You can check that the two formulas are the same by yourself. <Footnote>To see this, use the first formula both for $P(fair | flipped heads)$ and $P(biased | flipped heads)$, and divided them. </Footnote> To understand this rephrasing, it's good to think in terms of [odds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds). This is how people in the gambling industry sometimes use probabilities: instead of saying $1/3$ probability of this and $2/3$ of that, they say that odds are 1:2. Odds are like probabilities, but they don't sum up to one -- odds 1:2 are the same as 2:4. This is actually sometimes useful, if you understand implicitly that probabilities have to be normalized, but don't want to bother writing it in your equations.

Using odds, the Bayes' formula now makes a plenty of sense if you ask me! It's just this:

![Bayes' theorem using odds](01-kl_intro/bayes_theorem.png)

That is, we write the prior odds $P(fair) : P(biased)$. Then we write down the ratio $P(flipped heads | fair) : P(flipped heads | biased)$ of how likely heads are under both hypotheses. Probability expressions of the type $P(something happens | hypothesis)$ are called _likelihoods_, so this is also called the likelihood ratio.

These are the two relevant parts of the equation. Bayes' theorem says we should do the simplest thing possible with them -- multiply them -- to arrive at the posterior $P(fair | flipped heads) : P(biased | flipped heads)$ .

## Keep flipping

KL divergence is about what happens if we keep flipping the coin. That is, what happens if our Bayesian hero keeps flipping a coin and after each flip, she applies Bayes' theorem to update her belief? The picture you should have in mind is this one:

![Repeated application of Bayes' theorem](01-kl_intro/repeated_bayes.png)

As our hero keeps flipping, she keeps multiplying her posterior by one of the two likelihood ratios, $5/4$ for each head, and $5/6$ for each tail.

For example, in our picture, three tails out of five flips point slightly towards the biased hypothesis. So, after we normalize the posterior odds to probabilities, we find out that the original prior of about $67\%$ for the coin being fair dropped by $3\%$. Clearly, we need much more flips to find out what the truth is.

## Measuring evidence in bits

Before we dive into what's going on in here, it will turn out to be easier to take logarithm of all numbers. So, let's rephrase our picture that way; since our logarithms are base-2, we will often sometimes talk about the exponents as _bits_.

![Repeated application of Bayes' theorem in log scale](01-kl_intro/repeated_bayes_log.png)

Whenever we flip heads, instead of multiplying the posterior odds by $0.5$ and $0.4$, we think of adding $-1$ to the sum of evidence towards fair hypothesis, and adding $-1.32$ to the sum of evidence towards biased hypothesis. In the end, the difference is what counts, so we can also think of this as the fair hypothesis gaining $0.32$ bits of evidence against the biased hypothesis.

In the end, the fair hypothesis gained $0.32$ bits of evidence to its favor twice, but the biased hypothesis got $0.26$ bits three times. $3 \cdot 0.26 - 2 \cdot 0.32 \approx 0.15$, so the total evidence we accumulated is $0.15$ bits towards the coin being biased. We started with one bit of evidence towards the fair hypothesis, so our posterior is $0.85$ bits towards the fair hypothesis; this turns out to correspond to $64\%$ probability.

## Expected Distinguishing Evidence <a id="expected-distinguishing-evidence"></a>

So, let's analyze what will happen after $N$ flips, for some large $N$.

Presumably, as we keep flipping and updating our posterior by Bayes' theorem, the truth should get more and more likely. But how quickly? That's what KL measures.

How quickly are we gathering evidence in favor of the coin being biased? To analyze this, it is simpler to take logarithms of the ratios so that we add rather than multiply. Instead of multiplying by the ratio $40/50$, we add $\log_2(40/50) \approx -0.32$ and for $60/50$ we add $\log_2(60/50) \approx 0.26$.

Since $\log_2(1/2) = -1$, we can describe our three-flip experiment as follows: We started with $-1$ bit of prior evidence favoring the coin being biased. After the first flip, the evidence becomes $-1-0.32 = -1.32$ bits; after the second flip, $-1.32+0.26 = -1.06$ bits; and after the third, $-1.06+0.26 = -0.8$ bits.

You can explore this concept of evidence accumulation interactively with the simulator below:

<EvidenceAccumulationSimulator />

In general, since the coin is biased, each flip yields $0.26$ bits of evidence with probability 0.6 and $-0.32$ bits with probability 0.4. The average evidence per flip is:

$$
0.6\cdot 0.26 - 0.4\cdot 0.32 \approx 0.03\text{ bits}
$$

Notice that this expression is exactly the KL divergence computed for the true distribution $(0.6,0.4)$ and the model $(0.5,0.5)$.

The positive average evidence indicates that, on average, each flip provides approximately 0.03 bits of evidence in favor of the true (biased) hypothesis. By the law of large numbers, if you flip the coin $n$ times, you would expect to accumulate about $0.03\cdot n$ bits of evidence.

### Zooming Out: KL as Expected Evidence <a id="zooming-out-kl-as-expected-evidence"></a>

Zooming out, we can view KL divergence as the expected evidence obtained per observation in favor of the true hypothesis $p$ when comparing it against an incorrect model $q$. Here, $p_i$ in the KL formula represents the probability of the $i$th outcome under the true distribution, and the term $\log(p_i/q_i)$ represents the evidence for the true hypothesis when outcome $i$ occurs. The overall KL divergence is the expected evidence per trial, with the logarithm ensuring that evidence accumulates additively.

KL divergence is thus about the evidence, not the prior. This is why it is relevant in both classical (frequentist) and Bayesian statistics.
