# Resources <a id="resources"></a>

We compile our favorite resources for further exploring KL divergence and related topics. Resources are organized roughly by difficulty level from introductory to advanced.

## Our mind map


Coming soon - we're preparing a comprehensive visual mind map that will show how all the concepts connect together.
