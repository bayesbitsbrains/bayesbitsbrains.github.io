## Algorithmic Information Theory (Kolmogorov Complexity)

> **Riddle:** Consider the set of all C programs of length 1000 characters that print the first million digits of $\pi$. Sample one such program uniformly at random. What is it likely to look like?

**Kolmogorov Complexity $K(x)$:**
The Kolmogorov complexity of a string $x$ (relative to a universal Turing machine U) is the length of the _shortest_ program $p$ that outputs $x$ when run on U.
$$ K(x) = \min\_{p: U(p)=x} |p| $$
It measures the minimum description length or the inherent complexity of the object $x$.<Footnote>Technically depends on the choice of U, but only by an additive constant.</Footnote>

**Connection to Entropy:**
For typical strings $x$ drawn from a distribution $P$, the expected Kolmogorov complexity is close to the Shannon entropy $H(P)$. Strings that are highly compressible have low $K(x)$. Random strings have $K(x)$ close to their length.

**Solomonoff Induction:**
A formal theory of inductive inference. It assigns a prior probability to any string $x$ based on its Kolmogorov complexity:
$$ P*{Solomonoff}(x) \approx \sum*{p: U(p)=x} 2^{-|p|} \approx 2^{-K(x)} $$
This prior favors simpler explanations (those with shorter programs). It provides a theoretical (though uncomputable) basis for Occam's Razor and Bayesian inference.

_Answer to Riddle:_ The random 1000-char program is overwhelmingly likely to be incompressible garbage that _happens_ to print the digits (e.g., containing the digits explicitly, padded with junk). A short, elegant algorithm computing $\pi$ is _extremely_ unlikely to be hit by random sampling of fixed-length strings. Solomonoff's prior assigns high probability to the elegant algorithm but low probability to the random string.

**Connection to Deep Learning:** Training large models can be seen as a search for a compressed representation (the model weights) that can generate the observed data. Models that generalize well often find simpler, more compressible solutions, echoing the spirit of Solomonoff induction.<Cite>Hutter2004UID</Cite>

## Thermodynamics, Stat Mech, and Game Theory Links

<a id="statmech-boltzmann"></a>
### Statistical Mechanics & Boltzmann Distribution As seen in Part 2, the Boltzmann distribution $p_i \propto e^
{-E_i / kT}$ is the maximum entropy distribution subject to a constraint on average energy $\mathbb{E}[E]$. This
fundamental link connects information entropy with thermodynamic entropy.
<Footnote>Though the exact relationship and interpretation are subjects of ongoing discussion.</Footnote>

<a id="multiplicative-weights-games"></a>
### Multiplicative Weights & Regret Minimization The Multiplicative Weights Update (MWU) algorithm is a simple and
powerful algorithm used in game theory, online learning, and optimization. It maintains weights for different
experts/actions and updates them based on observed losses: $$ w_i^{t + 1} = w_i^t \exp(-\eta L_i^t) $$ (where $L_i^t$ is
loss of expert i at time t, $\eta$ is learning rate) This update rule can be shown to be equivalent to minimizing a form
of KL divergence (related to regret) at each step. It naturally leads to strategies that converge towards Nash equilibria
in zero-sum games and minimize regret in online settings.<Cite>AroraHazanKale2012MWU</Cite>

**MWU Game Example:** Consider a zero-sum game where a player must choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The MWU algorithm adaptively learns the optimal strategy (play each with 1/3 probability) by exponentially reducing weights on actions that lose more often.

## Decision Theory & Variational Methods

<a id="decision-theory-utility"></a>
### Decision Theory Basics
Rational decision-making involves choosing actions to maximize *expected utility*.
$$ \text{Choose action } a \text{ to maximize } \mathbb{E}_{o \sim P(o|a)}[U(o)] = \sum_o P(o|a) U(o) $$
Here, $P(o|a)$ represents our probabilistic beliefs about outcomes $o$ given action $a$ (often informed by methods discussed in previous parts), and $U(o)$ is our utility function assigning value to outcomes. Information theory helps refine the $P(o|a)$ part.

<a id="variational-methods-vaes"></a>
### Variational Methods (ELBO Revisited)
Recap VAE ELBO from Part 3:
$$ \text{ELBO} = \mathbb{E}_{z \sim q(z|x)}[\log p(x|z)] - D_{\mathrm{KL}}(q(z|x) \| p(z)) $$
Maximizing the ELBO simultaneously tries to achieve good data reconstruction (first term) while keeping the learned posterior approximation $q(z|x)$ close to the prior $p(z)$ (second term, KL penalty). This KL term acts as a regularizer, preventing the model from collapsing latent codes and encouraging a smooth, structured latent space useful for generation. Variational inference, in general, uses KL divergence to find tractable approximations $q$ to intractable posterior distributions $p$.

<a id="diffusion-models-conceptual"></a>
### Diffusion Models (Conceptual Link) Modern generative models like DALL-E 2/3 and Stable Diffusion often use diffusion
techniques. These work by gradually adding noise to data (forward process) and then training a model (often a U-Net) to
reverse this process, gradually removing noise to generate data starting from pure noise. There are deep connections
between diffusion models, score matching (estimating $\nabla_x \log p(x)$), and thermodynamics/entropy. The denoising
process can be viewed as optimizing paths in probability space, often involving objectives related to KL divergence or
entropy changes over time.<Cite>SohlDickstein2015DeepUnsupervised, Ho2020DenoisingDiffusion</Cite>
