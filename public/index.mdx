# Applied Information Theory: A Computational Toolkit

_(Hero section and detailed introduction content will go here)_

This site explores the mathematical tools for understanding uncertainty, learning from data, building models, and making better decisions. We bridge abstract math with real-world intuition and applications, inspired by fields like statistics, machine learning, and the LessWrong community's focus on epistemology.

**How to Use This Site:**

Navigate through the parts using the main menu. Each part covers a major theme:

- **[Part 1: Quantifying](01-quantifying.mdx):** Measuring information, uncertainty, and differences.
- **[Part 2: Updating & Learning](02-updating.mdx):** Incorporating new evidence and constraints (Bayes, MaxEnt).
- **[Part 3: Modeling & Comparing](03-modeling.mdx):** Fitting models to data (MLE) and applications in ML/Stats/DL.
- **[Part 4: Advanced Connections](04-advanced.mdx):** Deeper dives and links to other fields.
