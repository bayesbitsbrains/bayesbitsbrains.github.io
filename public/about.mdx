# About This Mini-Course <a id="what-this-course-covers"></a>



This text was arose from a project of <a href="https://gavento.cz/">Tomáš Gavenčiak</a> and <a href="https://vaclavrozhon.github.io/">Vašek Rozhoň</a>; the website was written by Vašek. 

We were thinking about __open exposition problems__<Footnote>The phrase comes from one of my [favorite exposition papers](https://timothychow.net/forcing.pdf). </Footnote> - Inasmuch as there are open _scientific_ problems where we haven't figure out how the Nature works, there are also open _exposition_ problems where we haven't figure out the best way to convey our knowledge. We had a joint probability seminar at Charles University where we tried to work out how to teach some important, underrated topics. This text tracks some of what we did in that seminar. 

More concretely, I was motivated by two open problems:

- How to adapt our teaching of computer science theory to convey more about neural networks? 
- How can we use the current capabilities of LLM to teach better, in general? 

The first problem motivates the content, the second one the form. 

{/*
First, I try to collect various ideas at the intersection of probability, statistics, and information theory that we are typically not teaching in standard undergrad courses, and repackage them. The result hopefully gives some useful intuitions behind current ML in particular, and behind using probability to understand the world around us in general. 

Second, with current LLM capabilities, some ways of presenting math suddenly got doable. The current text is full of widgets that will hopefully help you learn by playing with them. Let's see how it works!
