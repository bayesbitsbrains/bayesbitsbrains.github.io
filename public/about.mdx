# About This Project

🔭 We (Tom and Vašek) met in 2025 and realized they are both excited by some aspects of probability theory related to how we can use it as lenses to understand the world around us. We are both fans of LessWrong-style rationality, but we are also academics, so we naturally wondered whether one can convey some of the rationalist insights and ways of looking at world in an academic course.

🧪 We decided to have a small experimental lecture at Charles university, and see what happens.

📐 Once we started teaching, we soon realized why university lectures look the way they do. 😅 It is hard to convey vibes, and it's good if the students have some kind of idea what you talk about, talked about, and plan to talk about. So, we postponed the ambitious and vague plan to later lectures and started to talk about a specific topic -- KL divergence. We kept postponing long enough to cover the topics you can find in this minicourse-webpage.

🚀 While KL divergence is a very specific topic, we feel that it's a pretty important part of the vague and ambitious goal we care about. It's closely related to all kinds of real-world applications of probability -- check out [Introduction](/00-introduction) to see for yourself!
