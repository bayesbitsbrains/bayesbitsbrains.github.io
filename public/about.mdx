# About This Project

_(Information about the authors, the motivation for creating the site, acknowledgements, contact info, etc. will go here)_

This website is based on lecture notes originally titled "Ode to KL" by Tomáš Gavenčiak and Václav Rozhoň, February 2025 (draft version).

It aims to provide an accessible yet rigorous exploration of applied information theory and related mathematical concepts for reasoning under uncertainty.
