# KL properties & (cross-)entropy

In this chapter, we'll see how KL divergence can be split into two pieces called _cross-entropy_ and _entropy_. 

<KeyTakeaway>
![Formula for KL divergence](02-crossentropy/crossentropy_entropy_formula.png)
Cross-entropy measures the average surprise of model $q$ on data from $p$. When $p = q$, we call it entropy. 
</KeyTakeaway>




## üß† Relative entropy = cross-entropy - entropy

Quick refresher: In the [previous chapter](01-kl_intro), we saw how KL divergence comes from repeatedly using Bayes' theorem with log-space updating:

<BayesSequenceLogWidget highlightSurprisals={true} />

Each step adds surprisals ($\log 1/p$) to track evidence.
Last time, we focused on the differences between surprisals to see how much evidence we got for each hypothesis. Our Bayesian detective just keeps adding up these differences.

But the detective could also add up the total surprisal for each hypothesis (green and orange numbers in the above widget), and then compare overall values. This corresponds to writing KL divergence like this:

<Math id="cross-entropy-decomp" displayMode={true} math='
\underbrace{\sum_{i = 1}^n p_i \log \frac{p_i}{q_i}}_{D(p,q)}
 \;\;\;=\;\;\;
\underbrace{\sum_{i = 1}^n p_i \log \frac{1}{q_i}}_{H(p,q)}
 \;\;\;-\;\;\;
\underbrace{\sum_{i = 1}^n p_i \log \frac{1}{p_i}}_{H(p)}
'/>

These two pieces on the right - $H(p,q)$ is called cross-entropy and $H(p)$ is entropy - are super important. Let's get a feel for what they mean. 

##  ‚ùå Cross-entropy <a id = "cross"></a>
Think of cross-entropy as _how surprised are you on average when you see data from $p$ and you're modeling it as $q$._ 

Check it out in the widget below. The widget shows what happens when our Bayesian detective from the previous chapter keeps flipping her coin. The red dashed line is showing cross-entropy - the expected surprise of the model $q$ as we keep flipping the coin with bias $p$. The orange line shows the entropy - this is the expected surprise when both the model and actual bias are $p$. 
KL divergence is the difference between cross-entropy and entropy. You can notice that cross-entropy line is always above the entropy line (equivalently, KL divergence is always positive). 



If you let the widget run, you will also see a blue and a green curve - the actual surprise measured by our detective in the flipping simulation. We could also say that these curve measure cross-entropy - it is the cross-entropy between the _empirical distribution_ $\hat{p}$ (the actual outcomes of the flips) and the model $q$ (blue curve) or $p$ (green curve). The empirical crossentropies are tracking the dashed lines due to the [law of large numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers).

Bottom line: _better models are less surprised by the data and have smaller cross-entropy. KL divergence is how far our model is from the best one. _

## üé≤ Entropy

The term $H(p) = H(p, p) = \sum_{i = 1}^n p_i \log 1 / p_i$ is a special case of cross-entropy called just plain _entropy_. It's the best possible cross-entropy you can get for distribution $p$‚Äîwhen you model it perfectly as itself.  

Intuitively, entropy tells you how much surprise or uncertainty is baked into $p$. Like, even if you know you're flipping a fair coin and hence $p = q = \frac12$, you still don't know which way the coin will land. There's inherent uncertainty in that, the outcome of the flip still carries some surprise, even if you know the coin's bias. This is what entropy measures. 

The fair coin's entropy is <Math math = "H(\{\textsf{H: }1/2, \textsf{T: }1/2\}) = \frac12\cdot \log2 +  \frac12\cdot \log2 = 1" /> bit. 
But entropy can get way smaller than 1 bit. If you flip a biased coin where heads are very unlikely - say $p(\textsf{H} = 0.05)$ - the entropy of the flip gets close to zero. Makes sense! Sure, if you happen to flip heads, that's super surprising ($\log 1/0.05 \approx 4.32$). However, most flips are boringly predictable tails, so the _average_ surprise gets less than 1 bit. You can check in the widget below that $H(\{\textsf{H}: 0.05, \textsf{T}: 0.95\}) \approx 0.29$ bits per flip. Entropy hits zero when one outcome has 100% probability. 

Entropy can also get way bigger than 1 bit. Rolling a die has entropy $\log_2(6) \approx 2.6$ bits. In general, a uniform distribution over $k$ options has entropy $\log_2 k$‚Äîand that's the maximum entropy for any distribution with $k$ options. Makes sense‚Äîyou're most surprised on average when the distribution is, in a sense, most uncertain.

<Expand headline = "Example: correct horse battery staple">
Here's an example. Let's say there are about <Math math="2^{11}" /> English words that can be described as 'common'. If you generate uniformly four such common words and make your password the concatenation of them, the total entropy of your password is thus going to be $44$ bits. That's because entropy is a special case of cross-entropy and is thus additive. 

Having a uniform distribution with 44 bits of entropy is just a different way of saying that we have a uniform distribution with $2^{44}$ possible outcomes. 
The following comic wisely teaches us that this many possibilities make it a pretty secure password! Even if an adversary knows how we generated it, cracking it means they have to check about <Math math="2^{44}" /> passwords.

<Expand headline = "Conditional entropy" advanced={true}>

Let's go back to the mutual information that we [encountered in the first chapter](01-kl_intro/information-theory). This is a formula that we can apply to a joint distribution $(X,Y)$:

<Math displayMode={true} math="I(X;Y) = D((X,Y), X \otimes Y)" />

Intuitively, mutual information tells us how many bits we learn about $X$ when we find out the value of $Y$ (or vice versa‚Äîit's symmetric). This can be formalized using entropy. 

First, recall the entropy formula $H(X) = \sum_{x} P(X = x) \log \frac{1}{P(X = x)}$. This formula still works if we condition on knowing that $Y$ takes a certain value $y$. We can write
<Math displayMode={true} math="H(X | Y = y) = \sum_{x} P(X = x | Y = y) \log \frac{1}{P(X = x | Y = y)}" />
The conditional entropy $H(X|Y)$ is defined as the entropy of $X$ after I sample $Y$ and learn its value, i.e.:
<Math displayMode={true} math="H(X|Y) = \sum_{y} P(Y = y) H(X | Y =y)" />

Conditional entropy has some nice properties. One of them is that $H(X|Y) \le H(X)$. That is, learning the value of $Y$ is on average only decreasing the uncertainty about $X$. In fact, the difference between the two is exactly the mutual information!

<Math displayMode={true} math="I(X;Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y)" />
It is a good exercise to write down all the definitions to check that this is true. To get some intuition about this, guess what happens if we make $P$(‚òÄÔ∏è AND üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è$) = P$(‚òÅÔ∏è AND üö≤$) = \frac{1}{2}$ in the widget below.  

<MutualInformationWidget />

The mutual information is then 1 bit. That's because learning the value of one distribution, say transport, makes the entropy of weather smaller by 1 bit - the weather distribution changes from a coin flip ($H(\textrm{weather}) = 1$) to either determined ‚òÄÔ∏è or determined ‚òÅÔ∏è ($H(\textrm{weather} | \textrm{transport}) = 0$).

## üîê Relative entropy
KL divergence can be interpreted as the gap between cross-entropy and entropy. It tells us how far your average surprise (cross-entropy) is from the best possible (entropy). 
That's why in some communities, people call KL divergence the _relative entropy_ between $p$ and $q$. <Footnote>Way better name than 'KL divergence' if you ask me. But 'KL divergence' is what most people use, so I guess we're stuck with it. </Footnote>

## üß© Cracking riddles

Splitting a sum into two parts isn't exactly rocket science‚Äîthe real win is that cross-entropy and entropy are super meaningful concepts on their own. Let's see this in action. 

<Expand headline = "üîÆ How good are your predictions?"> <a id="application-evaluating-predictions"></a>

Time to solve our [prediction riddle](00-introduction#predictions). We asked experts to predict future events‚Äîhow do we score them?

### Idealized KL score

To grade predictions, let $p = (p_1, \dots, p_n)$ be the true probabilities of the events we ask our experts about, and $q$ be what the expert predicted. It for sure seems like a good idea to give the expert the following score:

<Math displayMode={true} math="S_{KL}(q) = D(p,q)" />

That is, we know that KL divergence is measuring how well a model $q$ matches the reality $p$, so we just use this a score for the expert - the lower score the better. 

If all $n$ events are independent,<Footnote>They of course never are, but here we will always assume they are. </Footnote> this formula becomes:

<Math displayMode={true} math="S_{KL}(q) = \sum_{i = 1}^n  \left(
    p_i\log\frac{p_i}{q_i} + (1-p_i)\log\frac{1-p_i}{1-q_i}
    \right)" />


But wait‚Äîthere's a huge problem with this score. Can you spot it?

### üéØ Cross-entropy score

The problem: we have no clue what the "true" probabilities are! <Footnote> We could go down a philosophical rabbit hole about whether "true" probability even is even a meaningful concept. But let's not. </Footnote>

All we know is what actually happened. This gives us an empirical distribution $\hat{p}$ where each $\hat{p}_i$ is either 0 or 1‚Äîit's all concentrated on the one outcome we saw.

What happens when we plug $\hat{p}$ into our KL score? Since $\hat{p}$'s entropy is zero (one outcome, no uncertainty), cross-entropy and relative entropy are the same: 

<Math displayMode={true} math="
S_{CE}(q) =
\sum_{i = 1}^n  \left(
    \hat{p}_i\log\frac{1}{q_i} + (1-\hat{p}_i)\log\frac{1}{1-q_i}
    \right)
"/>

This is why this formula is often called the _cross-entropy score_, though forecasting community calls it the [Log-score](https://forecasting.wiki/wiki/Log_score). 

### üîó Connection to the idealized score
Let's dig into how cross-entropy score relates to our idealized KL score. Technically, cross-entropy score is a random variable‚Äîit depends on which outcomes actually happen. Each $\hat{p}_i$ is 1 with probability $p_i$, otherwise 0.

So what's the expected cross-entropy score? Since $E_p[\hat{p}_i] = p_i$, linearity of expectation gives us:

<Math displayMode={true} math="
E_p[S_{CE}(q)] =
\sum_{i = 1}^n  \left(
    p_i\log\frac{1}{q_i} + (1-p_i)\log\frac{1}{1-q_i}
    \right)
"/>

In other words, <Math  math="E_p[S_{CE}(q)] = H(p,q)"/>. Nice! Give experts lots of questions, and by the law of large numbers, their score will approach the cross-entropy $H(p,q)$ between the true distribution and their guess. This is analogous to how [in the cross-entropy widget above](#cross), the blue line is different each time you run the experiment (it is random variable), but it tracks the dashed red line (the law of large numbers). 

Now remember:
<Math id="entropy-relation" displayMode={true} math="D(p,q) = H(p,q) - H(p)" />
We can't compute $D(p,q)$ directly, but here's the key insight: for two experts with predictions $q_1, q_2$, we have $D(p,q_1) < D(p, q_2)$ if and only if $H(p, q_1) < H(p, q_2)$. They only differ by $H(p)$, which doesn't depend on the experts' predictions. So:

_Comparing experts by cross-entropy is just as good as comparing by KL divergence in the long run!_

<Expand headline="Example: Coin flipping">
Let's make this concrete. We flip a fair coin $N$ times ($p_1 = \dots = p_N = 1/2$). Expert 1 nails it ($q_1 = \dots = q_N = 1/2$), while Expert 2 is a bit off ($q'_1 = \dots = q'_N = 0.6$).

The idealized KL scores: $KL(p, q) = N \cdot 0 = 0$ and $KL(p, q') = N \cdot D(p_1, q'_1) \approx 0.03 \cdot N$.

We can't see these scores, but we can compute cross-entropy. For large $N$, the law of large numbers says the scores will be roughly $H(p,q) = N$ and $H(p, q') \approx 1.03 \cdot N$. Both are bigger by $H(p) = N$‚Äîthe inherent uncertainty of coin flips. Even the perfect expert gets a high score! But since both shift by the same amount, cross-entropy still picks the best expert just like KL would. 

Key point: this only works _in the long run_. With just 8 predictions, any scoring is pretty noisy. 
</Expand>

Try the log-score on our example! Also, you can compare it with other popular score called brier score, which is just the so-called mean squared error or $\ell_2$ metric (i.e., if you predicted 0.8 probability and the event happens, your score is $(1-0.8)^2 = 0.04$). Brier score does not really care whether your failed prediction had probability of $0.9$ or $0.9999$.
